# End-To-End-Stock-Market-Kafka-Real-Time-Data-Engineering-Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates an End-to-End Real-Time Data Engineering Pipeline for processing live stock market data using Apache Kafka and AWS services. Below are the key aspects of this project:

### Real-Time Data Streaming
1. Fetching live stock market data and streaming it into Apache Kafka topics.
2. Implementing Kafka Producers and Consumers in Python.

### Cloud-Based Data Pipeline (AWS)
1. Utilizing Amazon S3 to store streaming data.
2. AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing.

### Data Processing & Querying
1. Using AWS Athena to analyze and query real-time stock data efficiently.
2. SQL-based transformations and analytics on the ingested data.
   
### Scalable & Distributed Architecture
1. Leveraging Kafka's scalability for handling large-scale real-time data streams.
2. AWS services for cost-effective cloud-based data management.
   
### Technology Stack
1. Python, Apache Kafka, AWS (S3, Glue, Athena), SQL.
2. Ensuring end-to-end data ingestion, processing, and analysis in real-time.
